Quantum tic-tac-toe. The best way to learn a new programming language is to write a game. It requires mastery of the toolchain and typically requires some of the more obscure aspects of the language. In this case, the language is AI, the toolchain includes the ChatGPT prompt, Github, html, markdown notation, graphical elements, a suitable web programming language (Python perhaps), etc. Our development will follow two meta principles of programming, the spec as code, and red-green-refactor via regression tests. These elements will experience multiple iterations as the spec, code, and regression tests are refined. The spec should be in markdown notation suitable for storage in a Github repo. From this evolving spec the executable code and regression tests shall be derived (your job) which will occur iteratively until a complete and playable game is finished, one suitable to demonstrate some basic quantum principles (superposition, collapse, an objective measurement mechanism, etc.). Keep a log of all prompts (just the prompts, not your responses) which I will ask for from time to time as a single downloadable file. Before we begin, confirm your understanding of the vision and the deliverables.

Got it. Here’s my understanding of the vision and deliverables:  

- **Goal:** Develop a Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe game using AI and web technologies as a toolchain.  
- **Process:** Iterative development, using the “spec as code” principle and red-green-refactor cycle via regression tests.  
- **Spec storage:** Markdown format in a GitHub repo.  
- **Logging:** Maintain a log of all prompts, to be downloadable at any time.  
- **Deliverables:** Iteratively refined spec, code, and regression tests leading to a playable game demonstrating quantum principles (superposition, collapse, measurement).  

I understand that my role is to generate spec, code, and tests based on your prompts, and to log all prompts accurately.

Very close, but a number of caveats. The iterative changes should be small so that a scan of the commits in the Git repo are easy to follow. When we need to refactor (large changes) that will be the only change for those commits which will include an appropriate commit message. The initial UI can be minimal, but we will want to explore various animations of the cyclic entanglements. This is best down with object oriented code, where various animations can be dropped in, plug and play like. Uninstantiated animation code can stay in the code base as reference, future use, or variations of the game to highlight different quantum features. Finally, the original paper (AJP 2006) had the player which did not create the cyclic entanglement choose the collapse. There were thus two types of moves; placement moves (a portent of unitary evolution) and collapse moves (a portent of collapse by measurement). This balanced the game strategically. But let add a toggle to the UI that

Understood — thanks for tightening the vision. Here’s how we’ll refine the plan:  

- **Small iterations:** Each commit changes only a few files, to keep the Git history easy to follow.  
- **Refactor commits:** Large changes (e.g., major UI reorganization) are separate commits with clear messages.  
- **Animation code:** Use object-oriented patterns so different animation classes can be added/removed without affecting game logic. Unused animation code can remain for reference.  
- **Gameplay mechanics:** Implement two move types: placement (unitary evolution) and collapse (measurement). Add a UI toggle so the player can choose collapse vs placement when allowed.  

We will structure everything in the repo to accommodate this plan.

Excellent. Let’s start with Step 1: create a **spec skeleton** in Markdown. This skeleton will define:  

- The title and description of the game.  
- The game board layout.  
- Player move rules (placement and collapse).  
- Logging and testing requirements.  
- File structure in the repo.  

Once we have the skeleton, we can begin generating the first minimal working code.

Perfect. Next, let’s generate the **repository skeleton**:
